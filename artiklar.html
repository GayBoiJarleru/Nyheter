       <p></div> <h1>This Ancient Oak Has Just Been Voted England’s Favorite Tree for Its 1,000-Year Legacy of Luck</h1>
            <img src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/693/693603.jpg" class="bild1" alt="Fint träd">
      <h3>This 11th century tree tucked away in the suburbs of Liverpool has just won a 21st century prize.
   Liverpool’s Allerton Oak tree—which is said to have been present in the city when the Normans conquered England in 1066—has just won England’s 2019 Tree of the Year award: a contest which has been celebrating trees for their beauty, character, and special history across Ireland and the UK since 2014.
   Receiving 34% of the 11,000 votes in the contest, the Merseyside Oak defeated a sycamore growing atop a castle in Essex and “The Dragon Tree” on the Isle of Wight to claim the coveted arboreal prize. Allerton Oak will represent its home country in the 2020 European Tree of the Year contest held next year.
   According to local legend, The Dragon Tree is actually the body of a fearsome dragon, slain by a knight returning to England from the Holy Land. Upon its death, the dragon’s body turned into a gnarled oak; its feet digging into the ground to become roots.

   The Allerton Oak, on the other hand, is believed to be more than 1,000 years old—and it has played a far greater part in Liverpool’s history than simply standing still and converting CO2 to oxygen. A placard at the foot of the great tree reads “One thousand years ago, Allerton did not possess a courthouse and it is believed that the sittings of the Hundred Court were held under the spreading branches of this tree.”
   In World War II, Liverpoolians who were off fighting in Europe often received acorns and leaves from the Allerton Oak as a little piece of home, and a sign of strength to protect them in battle.
   In 1086, William the Conqueror requisitioned the famous Domesday Book, a large land registry, and one that has helped modern Britons snatch a glimpse of what was present on their island a thousand years before they were.</h3></p></div>

    <p><h1>Swimmer’s Mission to Expose Plastic Threat</h1>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XfGG8rR7WW8/maxresdefault.jpg" class="bild2" alt="Fint träd">
        <h3>Long-distance swimmer Benoit Lecomte has swum 555 kilometres over the course of three months through the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch to highlight the issue of plastic consumption.
        
        The 52-year-old Frenchman sailed from Honolulu to San Francisco, swimming through the 79,000-ton trash vortex he describes as mainly “an underwater smog of microplastic.” He spent eight hours a day in the water, finding everything from abandoned fishing nets to old toilet seats.
        
        His supporting crew collected microplastic samples and placed GPS tags on floating plastic waste, so that researchers can better understand how plastics move through the oceans. “All the plastic I saw didn’t surprise me,” Lecomte said afterwards. “I was expecting it to be pretty bad. But after seeing it, day after day, I became numb to it—and my numbness surprised me.” </h3></p></div>

    <p><h1>Bearded vultures make an Alpine comeback</h1>
        <img src="https://dinoanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bearded_vulture-1.jpg" class="bild3" alt="Fint träd">
        <h3>The bearded vulture (pictured) was hunted to extinction in the Alps in the early 20th century, but it is making a remarkable comeback. This year, a record 35 vulture chicks took to the skies, thanks to a 30-year reintroduction project. Fifty pairs of bearded vultures now
        breed in the French Alps.
        
        “People used to believe these vultures would carry off small children and sheep,” explains Théo Mazet, a French naturalist helping to re-establish the birds. In fact, the bearded vulture, or lammergeier, is the only bird species to live on a scavenged diet of animal bones—and that’s useful, says Mazet.
        
        Unlike wolves and bears, the vultures don’t prey on cattle or game. “They act as rubbish collectors, which helps keep the mountain environment healthy,” he says.</h3></p></div>
